# Weather Cards

These 4 animated weather cards feature the local weather, the weather in Tokyo and New York City as well as the weather in Mars.

3 of the cards use the same geolocation API. For the Mars weather card, an API provided by the NASA in combination with the CSIC-INTA relays the data found by the Mars Rover Curiosity. The Curiosity contains a series of environmental sensors known REMS that collect the weather data in Mars.

The cards have individual animations with sunsets and meteor showers that activate when you hover your mouse over them.
